# DreamKeepers
a user-friendly dream journal app for Android that enables users to effortlessly capture, organize, and revisit their dreams. With intuitive features like adding dream entries with dates, titles, and descriptions

The files were too large to upload so i have added the important ones like the res folder / anim folder / java codes for main and the other 3 fragments as well as the layout, keep in mind this and copy them in the respective folders to make this work properly.

# DreamKeepers - Dream Journal App

DreamKeepers is a dream journal app developed for Android, allowing users to record and organize their dreams in a convenient and intuitive manner. I named the app originally "Aadat," which is derived from the Hindi word meaning "Habit," reflecting its purpose of helping users cultivate the habit of recording and exploring their dreams.

## Features

- **Dream Journal:** Users can easily add new dreams to their journal by specifying the date, title, and description of the dream.
- **RecyclerView:** The app utilizes a RecyclerView to present the dream list, enabling smooth scrolling and efficient navigation through dreams.
- **Floating Action Button:** A floating action button is available to provide a quick and effortless way for users to add new dreams to their journal.
- **Dialog Box:** When adding a new dream, a user-friendly dialog box appears, prompting users to enter the dream's date, title and edit the description.
- **Animation:** The main activity of Aadat features a visually appealing animation effect (fade-in) that enhances the overall user experience.
- **Custom Adapter:** Aadat employs a custom adapter called DreamAdapter to efficiently manage and handle the dream list within the RecyclerView.
